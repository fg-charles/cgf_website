        <p>&emsp;This quarter I moved into an appartment on campus, thinking that time away from my family would
        help improve as a person. Since AU 23, when I decided to aim for the CSE program, I had lived a pretty disciplined
        lifestyle (with some exceptions like in early SP 24). I had specific and somewhat rigorous routines I would follow very
        consistently.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; My latest involved waking up at 1am, meditating 1h, setting food to cook, exercising and stretching, taking a cold shower,
        cleaning the kitchen for my family, eating, then working for 11 hours before doing 1h hour of meditation and going to
        sleep at 5pm. However, difficulty sleeping, work related stress (I felt like I didn't have enough time in the day to stay
        on top of schoolwork, join clubs, do projects, and prepare for technical interviews and felt I was too drowsy in the morning
        to do good work, leading to me drinking coffee which aggrevated the sleep issues), and diet related stress
        (I felt i was too fat and restricted my diet in an attempt to be borderline underweight and was pretty inconsistent with
        it  because I felt so hungry and cheated on my diets, leading to guilt and stress), led me to drastically change my lifestyle.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; I noticed that all the great programmers I knew of were driven by genuine passion for what they did, not discipline, so I
        tried to switch to a lifestyle that would spark passion and love for computers and programming. This involved reading sci-fi,
        watching videos and listening to podcasts from skilled programmers etc. I decided to daily drive arch linux, and ended up looking
        for a CLI for google calendar when I found the project gcalcli, which had some screenshots featuring some really cool looking
        desktop environments (they ended up being dwm rices). I decided I wanted to make my computer look like that, and that's how I discovered
        ricing and the whole linux community around it. I started watching a lot of bugswriter and luke smith which caused me to reconsider
        my career trajectory and changed my values considerably.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Up to this point I was trying to get into full-stack web development, having heard that it was the current "meta" for breaking
        into the brutal software market. I had been a devout buddhist, and my plan was to work long enough to become a monk in thailand.
        Programming was just a means to that end, I had no interest or passion for it. Watching these youtubers, who were very passionate
        and skilled, inspired me greatly and showed me that becoming a "normie" react developper who doesn't understand his system or how
        computers work in general was not what I wanted to do. I became much more interested in minimalist systems and websites, getting
        good at the terminal, and understanding deeply how computers work at a low level.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Along with this new passion, it also made me cynical about working in big tech creating proprietary software. I adopted
        (and still hold) the view that these companies largely make intruisive, bloated, and bad software that infinges the privacy
        of its users while delivering an unpleasant experience. This put me at a weird spot where I didn't really know what to do with my
        life. My buddist drive had dissipated and been replaced with this less directed worldview. I felt conflicted and confused.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; I started asking everyone for advice, started seeing a psychiatrist, and was all around a bit of a mess. I had very little
        discipline or work ethic and started breaking many of the restrictions I had placed on myself as a buddhist: no sexual activity,
        no media (music, shows, images, books etc), wearing the same thing everyday, and eating the same thing everyday. The last diet-related was kind of complicated.
        During the 1am-5pm routine I would eat the same thing every day in one big meal. When I changed routines, I decided I would
        make that one meal keto, and have it at night, in hopes it would make me less drowsy and lethargic when working, and that the
        ketosis would increase my focus and increase my productivity. I bought a bunch of nuts and seeds and salad, however the 
        ingredients were hard to measure, so it was more freeform than my previous diet. This led me to overeat considerably, especially
        since my body was craving the little starch that was in the food.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; After trying desperately to hold onto that diet, I gave it up and started stuffing myself with animal products. I went from
        weighing 58kg to 70kg to 2.5 weeks. I was also binge watching shows like Serial Experiments Lain and Mr. Robot and had an
        erratic sleep schedule. Not good. I basically became a bad person and was wasting my life away, and burdenning everyone around me.
        I went to Utah during winter break with my family, and there I decided I needed to be independent and completely accountable for my
        actions. Having a safety net can often make you complacent, and I felt getting rid of mine was the surefire way to get me to
        straighten up my life. Having largely abandoned Buddhism, I felt I couldn't come back to it and use it as my reason for discipline again.
        At the very least, I needed to get away from my family, which is why I decided to get an appartment, which (ironically) my parents generously
        allowed and paid for.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; I started wearing the same thing everyday again, stopped going to therapy, and moved into my new place on the 1st. I bougth a ThinkPad x61
        and started working solely on that. I moved in and refused to get a desk, saying I would work on the floor. This was not comfortable, and I did
        not stick to it long enough for it to become comfortable. I continued to binge-eat, binge-watch, and indulge in porn. I had no organization since
        my previous system revolved around google calendar and I refused to use that. The ThinkPad sucked: the screen was super dim and tiny making it
        something you didn't want to use. I spent days and days configuring my laptop and neovim, which was actually a lot of fun but also quit hard.
        One of my courses (CSE 332) was taught in Java. They intended you use Intellij, but being a free software evangelist, I refused, and tried
        to configure neovim for java development. I even stubornly refused to use lsp-setup and meson, setting up lsp servers manually, making everything
        harder than it needed. Our first homework was due in four days (homeworks are big project-like assignments) and I didn't even have my environment ready.
        I also had exercises due three times a week and a project due in a week for my other class (CSE 333). I felt overwhelmed and dropped CSE 332.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; After wrestling with myself for a while, I stopped using the thinkpad and started using a more modern computer. I then started working on
        campus because I was not enjoying the ground very much. Eventually, after much hesitation, I moved my desk into my appartment as well as my desktop.
        I continued unhealthy indulging in pleasure, although I started making efforts to stop. I tried getting back into something similar to my old routine,
        and was running everyday to Gasworks park for a week, which led to big blisters on my feet. I tried making makeshift blackout curtains by taping
        trash bags with painter's tape in hopes of adopting a nocturnal lifestyle. The tape did not hold. I tried again a while later with ducktape and it
        worked, but it was too depressing not having any light from outside and I took it down. I continued overeating, bing-watching shows, and being
        sexually active despite teling myself I would stop.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; My grades on CSE 333 exercises were not good: 2/3's and 1/3's. I got concerned and did the math and saw that I was on track to failing,
        so I sarted working a lot harder. I was (am) dedicated on graduating with an >3.8 GPA. I got pretty obsessive about getting the exercises perfect
        and started getting 3s. Thankfully my project grades were good from the start (>95%) and I continued doing well on those. For a week before the
        midterm I did 3 practice midterms a day, re-doing any that I even a little bit wrong. I scored 100% on the midterm; one of the most exhilerating
        test-taking experiences I've had. I was racing with the guy next to me and was smoking him terribly. I finished the exam 30-40m early.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; My friend theo had landed me a gig doing web-dev for UW Bothell's health department. It was a somewhat large Next.Js project deployed on
        Vercell. By this time I knew I wanted to get off the web-dev train and was not enthusiastic. I quit a couple weeks after joining without having
        accomplished much. I applied to another UW Advanced Robotics and got rejected. I started going through the textbook Computer Systems: A Programmer's
        Perspective, and doing one leetcode problem a day. I still had an erratic lifestyle and sleep schedule during this time, but I was doing some things right.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; This past week I finished my CSE 333 project a week early and pulled an all-nighter binge-watching Silicon Valley. The day after the all-nighter
        I went back home to get duck-tape and patches for my elbows I had delivered to the wrong address on amazon. My mom asked why I was so tired and I dodged
        the question. Yesterday (or I should say today) I went to bed at 06:00 and woke up 12:00. Yesterday I really did some good work though. I planned
        all my coursework until graduation. My recent interest in low-level programming has led me to switch to computer engineering in hopes of becoming an
        embedded systems engineer. I concatenated a bunch of requirements for jobs I really want. I also set up an sc-im spreasheet that I can use to
        easily keep track of my time-use like I used to back when I was very disciplined. It's working quite well. Today I made this whole website.
       
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp; Recently I've been listening to hyperpop while coding. I find it very helpful. I have a bad tendency to think too much and not type enough when
        doing computer stuff, and I feel this music helps me go beyond that. I've been listening using my airpod pros, but they get uncomfortable after prolonged
        use. I suspect it's unhygenic as well, so I bought a pair of 90$ headphones. I hesitated a lot before buying it, and I'm still not sure it it was a good
        move.
